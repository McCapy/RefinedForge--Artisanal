This plugin allows you to create custom attacks, combos with slashes, thrusts, blanks, and MagicShots

This was inspired from a server called **runeblade.minehut.gg**
created by **@grimmace.** on discord

So, I created this plugin with the idea in mind for people to be able to make servers similar to runeblade, using this plugin

It allows you to do pretty similar things to runeblade, obviously some limitations are present however I plan to limit these limitations over time, like as of 2/26/2026 there is a lack of control over the thrust & magicshot attacks, eventually I will add more control over this.

I **highly** reccomend checking out **runeblade.minehut.gg** it's quite a fun server and I think you might like it! 

Enjoy the plugin, if you want more version coverage dm me, if you want some changes, request them!

Sincerely, **McCapy** **(mc_capybara_iii)**
