# Tutorial, this covers how to use commands related to this plugin,
# as well as how to use the given settings provided for the Attacks
#

EXAMPLE:

  # This is the name of the combo that will be stamped on an item, I might add a way to change this dynamically
  # via a new variable located on the outskirts of the combo, eg: name: '&cCapybara' this would make combos
  # look more aesthetically pleasing.

  # There should NEVER be more than 10 attacks, otherwise the internals will cause more calculation.

  duration: 15
  # how long (in seconds) till a combo concludes, ie once it concludes the combo, will reset to the first Attack
